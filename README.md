# PirateVariantsHPFix

This plugin modifies the HP of Pirate variants of ships (Bulwark to the Bastion, Mammoth to the Behemoth, Valkyrie to the Aerie), so that they have the most shield/hull HP values used by either variant.

So, basically buffs them. Because I think that works better since they're (so far) unique ships, and if that changes they'd be rare anyhow. Also because hull HP is worth less than shield HP so they kinda get scammed by the tradeoff.
